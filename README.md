### Now for a little internet optimism

# @窶指avi

Think of @窶指avi as a public space for your business, your projects, or
yourself. Provide as little or as much information as you want on your
profile, which will be made available to the public on our directory
(http://wavi.ng). You can opt to publish contact information, location,
media, social media links, even gamer tags. You have total control over
what other people see about you.

## Who is this for?

We have open sourced the @窶指avi mobile and desk app so that you can see how apps on The @ Platform
work. We also welcome issues and pull requests so that we can make @窶指avi
better.
